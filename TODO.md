## To Do

- Dotfiles:
    - [x] .zshrc and aliases
    - [ ] .git stuff (maybe not? Vaprobash should do this now)
- [ ] Automatically restart nginx upon boot somehow? Doesn't recognize vhosts that are synced in unless I do this manually.
- [ ] Global composer packages - include a file instead? Handle this myself?
- [ ] Use `www` dir outside of the repo or make this updateable without git (Composer? ehh) - having git repos within `www` is making things weird
- [ ] Add adminer or something similar to manage databases because all of the SQLite apps for Mac SUCK
